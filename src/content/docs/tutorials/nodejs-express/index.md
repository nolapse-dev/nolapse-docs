:::caution[Language support planned]
Node.js (`--lang nodejs`) is not yet available. This page previews what the tutorial will cover once the runner ships. No commands on this page will work until Node.js support is released.

## What This Tutorial Will Cover

When Node.js support lands, this tutorial will walk through:

1. Creating a minimal Express HTTP API with two routes (`GET /health` and `GET /greet`)
2. Writing Jest tests with `--coverage` to generate a `coverage/coverage-summary.json` report
3. Running `nolapse init --repo . --lang nodejs` to create the baseline
4. Simulating a coverage regression by removing a test
5. Running `nolapse run --repo . --lang nodejs` and seeing it exit 1
6. Adding a GitHub Actions workflow that gates PRs on coverage

## Expected Commands (Once Available)

### Initialise

```bash
nolapse init --repo . --lang nodejs
```

### Run a check

```bash
nolapse run --repo . --lang nodejs
```

### GitHub Actions workflow

```yaml
name: Coverage check

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Set up Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run nolapse
        uses: nolapse/nolapse-action@v1
        with:
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          lang: nodejs
          warn-threshold: "0.5"
          fail-threshold: "1.0"
```

---

## Coverage Report Format

nolapse will read Jest's `coverage/coverage-summary.json` format. To generate it, Jest must be configured with:

```json
{
  "coverageReporters": ["json-summary"]
}
```

Or in `jest.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  coverageReporters: ["json-summary", "text"],
};
```
